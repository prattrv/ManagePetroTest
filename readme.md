A simple CRUD CRM app made with React Native and targetted to iPad Air 2.  
The app uses Realm to store data locally.  
The data can be exported to a .csv file which is saved in the device's 'Downloads' directory. This allows importing the data after the app is reinstalled.  
There's also an option to email the csv. file to admin.
